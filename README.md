# Data-Wrangle-and-Analysis---WeRateDog-Tweet
Udacity course project
In this project, data of WeRateDogs Tweet were gathered, assessed, cleaned, and stored. Analysis based on the cleaned data was conducted and four insights were concluded. 

Here we studied four interesting questions as the following: 
1.	What is the most popular name(s) for dogs?
2.	Which stage of dogs has the highest rating?
3.	What breeds of dogs do people like most?
4.	What is the relation between rating and favorite counts?
